#### ***Class window.WXmlHttpRequest usable methods***

##### `constructor()`

The constructor function creates an object that has a property called xhr. The xhr property is an object that has a property called construct. The construct property is an object that has a property called addEventListener. The addEventListener property is a function that has a parameter called event. The event parameter is an object that has a property called target. The target property is an object that has a property called responseText. The responseText property is a string that has a value of null.

The constructor function also creates an object that has a property called xhr. The xhr property is an object that has a property called construct. The construct property is an object that has a property called addEventListener. The addEventListener property is a function that has a parameter called event. The event parameter is an object that has a property called target.
